# GPS Configuration Section
# ========================

# GPS Source Type: Choose one of the following:
#   'network' - For network GPS devices (TCP/UDP)
#   'serial'  - For serial GPS devices (USB, COM ports)
#   'gpsd'    - For GPSD daemon on Linux systems
gps_source = network

# GPS Update Interval (minutes): How often to check for new GPS data
# Recommended: 1-5 minutes for stationary use, 1 minute for mobile use
gps_update_interval = 2

[GPS_NETWORK]
# Network GPS Settings (used when gps_source = network)
# ===================================================

# Network GPS IP Address
# Example: 192.168.1.100 for local network GPS
gps_ip = 192.168.1.1

# Network GPS Port
# Example: 11010 for most network GPS devices
gps_port = 11010

# Network Protocol: 'tcp' or 'udp'
# Most network GPS devices use TCP
gps_protocol = tcp

# Connection Timeout (seconds): How long to wait for GPS connection
gps_timeout = 10

[GPS_SERIAL]
# Serial GPS Settings (used when gps_source = serial)
# ==================================================

# Serial Port Name
# Windows: COM1, COM2, COM3, etc.
# Linux: /dev/ttyUSB0, /dev/ttyACM0, /dev/ttyS0, etc.
serial_port = COM26

# Baud Rate: Speed of serial communication
# Common values: 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200
# Check your GPS device manual for the correct baud rate
serial_baud = 9600

# Serial Timeout (seconds): How long to wait for serial data
serial_timeout = 5

[GPS_GPSD]
# GPSD Settings (used when gps_source = gpsd)
# ===========================================

# GPSD Host: Usually 'localhost' for local GPSD
gpsd_host = localhost

# GPSD Port: Default is 2947
gpsd_port = 2947

# GPSD Timeout (seconds): How long to wait for GPSD connection
gpsd_timeout = 10

[APPLICATIONS]
# WSJT-X and JS8-Call Settings
# ============================

# WSJT-X UDP Port: Default is 2237
# Only change if you've modified WSJT-X's UDP port in Settings > Reporting
wsjtx_port = 2237

# JS8-Call UDP Port: Default is 2242
# Used for heartbeat detection only
js8call_port = 2242

# JS8-Call TCP Port: Default is 2442
# Used for grid updates
js8call_tcp_port = 2442

# Application Detection Timeout (seconds): How long to wait for program heartbeats
# Increase this if programs take longer to start
app_detection_timeout = 30

# Retry Interval (seconds): How long to wait before retrying failed operations
retry_interval = 5

# Max Retry Attempts: How many times to retry before giving up
max_retries = 3

[LOGGING]
# Logging Configuration
# ====================

# Debug Mode: Set to 'true' to enable console logging and detailed file logs
# Set to 'false' for normal operation (less verbose)
debug_mode = true

# Log Level: Choose logging detail level
# Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
# DEBUG = Most detailed, CRITICAL = Only errors
log_level = DEBUG

# Keep Logs: Number of recent log files to keep (older logs are automatically deleted)
# Recommended: 5-10 files
keep_logs = 5

[ADVANCED]
# Advanced Settings (usually don't need to change)
# ===============================================

# Grid Square Precision: Number of characters in grid square
# 4 = Standard 4-character grid (e.g., FN31)
# 6 = Extended 6-character grid (e.g., FN31ab)
# Most amateur radio applications use 4-character grids
grid_precision = 4

# Heartbeat Interval (seconds): How often to check if programs are still running
# Lower values = faster detection of program closure, higher CPU usage
heartbeat_interval = 10

# Sleep Interval (seconds): How long to sleep when no programs are detected
# Lower values = faster program detection, higher CPU usage
